# TOP FLOOR INDUSTRIES - Infrastructure Portal
**Project Status:** For Development / Professional Review

This portal represents the strategic digital presence of **TOP FLOOR INDUSTRIES**, designed to showcase operational excellence in Infrastructure Development and Manufacturing.

## 🛠 Technical Specification
- **Framework**: React 19 (ESM-native, zero-build required).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS CDN.
- **Navigation**: Hash-based SPA routing (`#home`, `#about-us`).
- **Deployment**: Optimized for **GitHub Pages**.

## 🚀 CRITICAL: GitHub Pages Setup
To fix the "Jekyll Conversion Error" and the `/docs` missing error:

1. **GitHub Repository Settings**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, ensure "Deploy from a branch" is selected.
   - Under **Branch**, select `main` (or your primary branch) and importantly, change the dropdown folder from `/(docs)` to **`/(root)`**.
   - Click **Save**.

2. **Jekyll Bypass**:
   - The `.nojekyll` and `_config.yml` files in this repository are configured to skip the Jekyll build process entirely, allowing your React ESM code to run natively in the browser.

## 📂 Core Divisions
- **Crushing & Screening**: High-throughput mobile and modular processing.
- **Asphalt Manufacturing**: Road-authority compliant surfacing materials.
- **Chrome Concentrate**: Mineral beneficiation and export-grade production.
- **Aggregate Supply**: Engineering-grade stones (G1-G5).
